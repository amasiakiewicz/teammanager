Solution contains api gateway (https://github.com/amasiakiewicz/gateway) that handles the incomming requests. It then communicates with service discovery lib (https://github.com/amasiakiewicz/eureka) in order to follow that requests further. Services are transfer (https://github.com/amasiakiewicz/transfer), which is responsible for charging fees and transfering funds, team (https://github.com/amasiakiewicz/team), which is responsible for handling team operations and player (https://github.com/amasiakiewicz/player), which is responsible for handling players operations. All services communicate with each other asynchronously through central event store based on Apache Kafka.
